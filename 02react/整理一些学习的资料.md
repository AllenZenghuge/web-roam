[What are Controlled Components in React?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-controlled-components)

> Having an uncontrolled element/component in your React application can lead to unwanted behavior and therefore bugs. You want to drive your UI from one source of truth instead; which in React should be props and state. Given the same props and state to a component, it should always render the same output: `(props, state) => view`.
