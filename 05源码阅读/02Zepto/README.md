# Zepto

> **Zepto** is a minimalist **JavaScript library for modern browsers** with a largely **jQuery-compatible API**. *If you use jQuery, you already know how to use Zepto.*
>
> While 100% jQuery coverage is not a design goal, the **APIs provided match their jQuery counterparts**. The goal is to have a ~5-10k modular library that **downloads and executes fast**, with a **familiar and versatile API**, so you can **concentrate on getting stuff done**.
